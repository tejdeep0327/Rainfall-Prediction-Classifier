# Rainfall Prediction Classifier

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning classifier to predict whether rainfall will occur based on meteorological data. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using popular classification algorithms.

## Dataset
The dataset contains historical weather data including features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and previous rainfall records. The target variable is a binary label indicating whether it rained on a given day.
