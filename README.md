# Rainfall Prediction Classifier

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning classifier to predict whether rainfall will occur based on meteorological data. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using popular classification algorithms.

## Dataset
The dataset contains historical weather data including features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and previous rainfall records. The target variable is a binary label indicating whether it rained on a given day.

- Source: [Provide Dataset source or link if public]
- Data format: CSV with features and target columns

## Features Used
- Temperature (Â°C)
- Humidity (%)
- Wind Speed (km/h)
- Atmospheric Pressure (hPa)
- Rainfall Yesterday (Yes/No)
- And other relevant weather attributes

## Models
The project evaluates several classification algorithms such as:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting Machines (optional)
